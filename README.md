SQL queries on two databases: employees and companyDB

This repository uses the Employees database available from [Employees DB on GitHub](https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db) as directed by the MySQL website [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/employees-installation.html). This file contains SQL queries that were completed on MySQL. 

MySQL queries were performed on companyDB, with data adapted from: R. Elmasri, S.B. Navathe (2016). Fundamentals of Database Systems, 7th Edition, Addison-Wesley.
